# Terraform Spotify GitHub

This repository contains a set of Terraform modules for managing GitHub
organization following the Spotify model.

You could read [Discover the Spotify model by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify)
to learn more about it.

**Nested Teams:** GitHub Team synchronization with Identity Providers feature
does not work with nested teams, therefore, you need to have a flat structure and
avoid such feature in GitHub if you would like to have such feature; because of
that, we do not use nested teams for chapters, and squads, rather, we rely on
the naming convention alone.
